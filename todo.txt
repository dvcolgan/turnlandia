Categories of actions:
Ones that simply take an action point:
    Recruit unit
    find food

Ones that change the terrain:
    Build road
    Build city
    Clear forest
    Mine ore
    Plant forest

Move
Attack

investigate fabric for automated deployment

surrender units button

turnlandia ai contest

add a time slider on the top of the screen that lets you view the last 5 or so turns
add signs

Instead of moving a unit on top a thing and directly building the thing with the unit, units are camps of units that can build things inside of their sphere of influence

Each unit is now called a camp
each camp gets one type of action per turn,
if you build a road, you can build one road square for every unit in the camp
if you build a city, you can place 1 city tile per 2 or 3 or 4 units in the camp
if you recruit, you get one unit the next turn
if you harvest wood, you can click on trees equal to the number of units in the camp, and you get 1 resource per tree you cut down, and then you can also mine mountains for ore

any resources that are gathered by a camp are held by that camp
in order to do things, a camp has to either gather resources, give resources to another camp, or get resources from a city

cities provide walls, enemy units can't walk through cities, they have to attack first
friendly units can walk through cities at road speed
recruitment happens at twice the pace in cities (maybe)

resource sources:
    each tree that you cut down gives 1-2-3 wood
    each mountain that you mine gives ore, maybe a mountain has a fixed amount of ore in it
    action scavenge for food gives 1 food for every 2 units that harvests
    cities just generate food?
    maybe have money, maybe not, you start with some

resource costs:
    movement costs food
    recruiting takes 2 food to get 1 unit from 2 other units
    roads take 1 wood
    cities take 2 wood and 2 ore
    cobblestone roads take 1 ore and must be placed on an existing road
    actions require food, 1 food per unit per action, at least


replanting:
    trees can be replanted but ore runs out in mountains
    if you harvest a mountain, it takes a number of turns before you can harvest it again (those squares have a depleted icon on them, maybe with a number of turns left until it can be remined?)
    have a plant tree action, which sprouts trees after a number of turns
    cities require 2 wood and 2 ore per square

how does attacking work:
    you get a bonus for being inside a city
    maybe you have to breach the wall around the outside of the city

surrender units to an enemy or ally

if you attack with a camp, you can click on any enemy unit in your area, and it will attack that unit if they stay in your range, movement happens first, then attacking

if you want to trade with someone, you click trade, and then click either on a city or a unit (including your own) it brings up an interface for trading, and it sends a trade request message to the other person, and if they accept or make a counteroffer befor ethe turn resolves, you do the trade, or you can make another counter offer to further the process

have a messages queue for trade requests and such

other players can trade resources with cities or other units

perhaps ore is only seen partially by players

make a radial thing for the buttons around the player


make the action buttons different colors

well trodden paths turn into dirt roads, cobble must be built





add select_related liberally to the resolve command








have a fixed 10-30 minute window of downtime at 12:00 right after the turn resolves
wrap the entire resolve command in a transaction

consider using this captcha: http://areyouahuman.com/about-playthru/

put the board on the homepage, perhaps even a live scrollable version of the board



make it so that when the turn is resolving, show a screen that says it is resolving, and if someone tries to make a move while the turn is resolving, redirect them to that page
fix firefox


add a turn timer to the top bar
when the turn resolves, generate all of the board json and put it into a redis cache, or the django cache or whatever

prevent moving a unit more than once somehow

grey out arrows when you are not hovering over a unit or something

make roads look like this?
http://i.imgur.com/CjbSFVN.png

use google closure compiler

instead of requiring email, add a captcha

show the hex value in the color field

make dirt roads upgradable to cobblestone roads and those are better for vehicles
Cache all of the json objects locally and have those in a global data store thingy

SHORTCUTS:
pageup/down to zoom
arrow keys to scroll the map
number keys to change current action


 fillOutlinedText: function(text, screenX, screenY) {
    TB.ctx.save();
    TB.ctx.font = 'bold 16px Arial';
    TB.ctx.fillStyle = 'black';
    TB.ctx.strokeStyle = 'black';
    TB.ctx.lineWidth = 1;
    TB.ctx.strokeText(text, screenX, screenY);
    TB.ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
    TB.ctx.fillText(text, screenX, screenY);
    return TB.ctx.restore();
  }


When a user scrolls to a part of the map offscreen, you first check to see if the store has it in it, if so don't send a request

add easter eggs
add konami code - when you enter it, the board tiles turn into ascii art
make it so that when you go to a certain distance out, there are mountains in the shape of ascii art

make tiles fly in somehow
Make the cron job that makes the game resolve
Read through the lodash documentation

The only time that you will ever see someone else's moves is during your initial placement, it will not allow you to place where other players are going to initially place, instead of showing the other players, it just marks all unavailable squares in red

add touch event handlers for tablets for moving units
Board stuff
    finalize the noise generator
    fix the board loader being off for higher zoom levels
    make zooming zoom where your cursor is
    caching of board data on the client
make it so that if you try to pathfind into an empty square, it will do it as soon as the board is loaded

be able to see the board in previous days with slider or something

have a swag store but don't call it swag because thats horrible to half of the people

Add server side logic for initial placements
add back walls?
natural disasters
have random events - maybe one before each turn
fix the problem where sectors aren't loading right away from the cache

fix the problem where firefox dies

make it so that if you try to do an action after the turn has resolved but you ar estill on the last turn, refresh the page


make the background image of the home page be the current board state
ways of monitizing the game:

have a store
pay for cosmetic enhancements (hats)

pay a montly fee
have an ad on the sidebar

Resource management

new players are given 20 units and some resources
you place your units anywhere you want, a certain distance away from all existing cities, but not necessarily existing players








{
    col: 4,
    row: 5,
    tile: 'city-center'
    owner: 32,
}

{
    col: 5,
    row: 5,
    tile: 'city'
    owner: 32,
}




Cities:
    you build cities on plains
    cities must be x squares from another city
    the city starts out as a 2x2 square?
    initial placement must be within a certain distance from another city
    Cities require wood
    Cities are surrounded by walls, only build buildings inside cities
    build farms around a city
    to trade with someone, you'd have to build a road between your cities
    cities have influence
    city roles
    you have to have more cities to support more units
    cities that span multiple squares
    the outer part of the cities have walls around them


Units:
    a single unit type
    tell units which square to go to and they will move there over the course of several turns
    for the initial settlement, you place down several units 20

    a unit carrying resources has a symbol on it showing the type of resource,
    if you hover over your unit, it tells you the quantities, if an enemy hovers it doesn't
    units can carry resources - if you die to another player's unit, that unit gets the resources of your unit
    New units require  food
    roads make it easier to move units
    units can carry resources - if you kill a unit you get its resources
    each unit can carry so many resources
    the speed at which you build something depends on the number of units building it
    units have to carry food with them , and it costs one food per turn and then one food per square moved
    units can carry money/resources and when units go to another city, they can either attack it or trade with it, and that generates money/resources?

    Rectangulartim: Moving units might make it very difficult to attack an enemy. If attacking happens before or after moving only, enemy units could just move through your lines of defense. If units automatically attack everything in their path, moving though an ally's territory would be quite annoying. Idea: Players could toggle their units states between aggressive and defensive. Aggressive units attack every unit within range, which doesn't belong to the same player. Defensive units don't attack anything. This way units of allied players can move through each other without problems, but you cannot sprint though a line of guards easily.

make new players spawn near other players
water, mountains, forests, plains as terrain

use arrows to move the map around

6 movement points per turn
roads = 1 point
plains = 2 points
forests = 3 points
mountains = 6 points?



all actions:
move unit
attack

build road

Allow users to specify their country of origin, 
add an admin gui so i can do stuff
do advance wars style arrow tracing the path of unit movement
  4 straight pieces, 4 corner pieces, one end piece needed
water, bridges, attacking bridges
roads to build

you can build roads on mountains or plains, you can cut down trees, you can build bridges over water, 

own water squares? maybe
currency and resources - make colgans the cu
jools64 has best coin


make a credits page





Atmospherium - you can only tunnel so much of a mountain before it collapses, kills all troops inside the tunnel, removes the tunnel
tunnels cost 


Moving requires food
Roads require wood

Spies and sabatoging could be interesting

market building - you have to 


vehicles (trade carts)



at the end of a turn it should give you a report of what happened






trade with other players

tunnels for mountains as roads for water

units
cities
food
wood
ore
money


I'll trade you 5 colgans for that - Rhif's idea

hats you can't trade, maybe you can find them rarely though

random settlements controlled by AI

enhance the hovered tile cursor thing

the amount of money increases as the size of players increase
a new player doesn't increase the amount of money in the game, you have to grow first

money is determined by the number of sectors in the game



Have a finite amount of money in the game that goes up with each player?

npc traders/barbarians

flags that you design yourself/coat of arms
equipment as a resource
http://imgur.com/MC7Bub2

you can trade with cities that have roads connecting them - jared314


can harvest wood, have to let it regrow
